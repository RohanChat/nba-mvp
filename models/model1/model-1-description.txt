Model 1 Description:
Input: 
A vector representing a 4 min slice of an NBA game 

Passes through a feed forward neural network

Output: final score of the game 



Questions:

How should we represent the vector?
    Simplest Model: 
    Just count the occurences of each event (ie: Shots made, shots missed etc.), keep a running score value
    Flatten the vector into a number of slices x number of features 
    Feed to the neural network 
    Output a prediction.

What should we do:
    Use AutoML to try to optimize parameters
